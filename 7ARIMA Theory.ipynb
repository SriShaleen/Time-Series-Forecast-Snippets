    "The lag tells us how far apart these 2 values are going to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lag_1 differencing means taking the difference between each two neighbouring values i.e. y(t) - y(t-1), this is useful for removing trend from series since the series of differences or jumps between values and will no longer contain a trend.\n",

    "- Another useful type of differencing is of Lag_M where M is number of seasons in our data.\n",
    "Lag_M differencing (i.e. y(t) - y(t-M) means subtracting the value from the same season in the previous cycle.\n",
    "It is useful for removing seasonality with M seasons. The differenced series will no longer dispplay seasonality.\n",

    "- Another differencing operation is called the 'Double Differencing'.\n",
    "In this we difference the series once, and then we apply differencing to the differenced series by appropriate lag interval. This will be useful if we want to remove both Trend and seasonality!\n",
